Pragmatic Web Developer
======

## It's not about what you've used, it's about why you chose to use it

**pragmatism**</br>
*noun*</br>
an approach that evaluates theories or beliefs in terms of the success of their practical application.</br>

Job ads that require you to have experience with a defined tech stack are so 2017. Sure, you'll have a big leg up over the competition for this one if you're familiar with Golang, full-duplex communications protocols/tools, reactive JS libraries and microservices architecture (think Netflix OSS) but they're by no means required.

The technologies mentioned above are about solving problems that present themselves when you're dealing with high traffic, continuously deployed web applications that demand modularity and efficiency. If you're interested in having engaging conversations (even with a recruiter!) about why you chose the tools you did to solve such problems, this opportunity is for you.

2017 proved that such developers are super rare so if you're one of them, what can you expect to receive in return?

* Incredibly difficult yet interesting challenges to tackle
* A highly talented team of humans to tackle them with
* The chance to work on a product built from the ground up using very modern technologies
* An organization that thinks of themselves as a software company first
* Super competitive renumeration
* Awesome company perks (drinks, food, all that jazz)

If all of this gets you excited and you're keen to see if you can hang, hit me up. 

See something dumb or incorrect in one of my ads? Let me know! Constructive criticism is always appreciated.

If you have an active GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket or Stack Overflow profile include a link because I want to see it!
