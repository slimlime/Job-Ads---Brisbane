# .NET Software-Human Interface

This role is about being more than just a code monkey. As a .NET Software-Human Interface (Read: Consultant), you will be embedded in companies ranging from smaller independent software vendors to large enterprises. Your job is to help them be all they can be while being hands-on in writing code alongside them. The end goal is to leave client-teams on a better trajectory than when you found them through improving both the codebase and the ways in which it's contributed to.

We’re bootstrapped and profitable, so we don’t have a board of directors to answer to or investors who need to make a return. This means we are in control of our growth and can do so at a pace that sustains our culture and prioritizes the happiness of our consultants.

**What you’ll be doing:**

* Helping build .NET applications.
* Mentoring and leading other developers on the value of Test Driven Development (TDD), CI/CD and other development best practises.
* Directly guiding the technical strategy for companies and exploring ways they can be better.
* Guiding companies through technical challenges and creating roadmaps that will impact their commercial future.

**What will be expected of you:**

* An expertise in working on the Microsoft stack.
* Experience working on cloud-hosted applications (preferably using Azure).
* A desire to guide companies and influence technical strategy.
* A thorough understanding and appreciation for TDD and writing highly scalable and maintainable code.
