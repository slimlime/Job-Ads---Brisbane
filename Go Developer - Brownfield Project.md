# Go Microservices Developer - Brownfield Project

Some companies make grand statements about their platform being an embodiment of cutting-edge technology, this one lets their code do the talking. The C++ of the 21st century (allegedly) is here and this is your chance to join a team that's embracing it with open arms. 

They're not Netflix or Spotify but their engineering philosophy and general workplace culture comes pretty damn close; they hire smart people to work to make smart decisions and provide an environment that allows them to do so.

'Senior' Go developers aren't really a thing right now but if you've been dabbling and would now like to get paid to use it, hit me up. Alternatively, if you come from a Python, Node.js or C++ background and are interested in getting aboard the Go train, I want to hear from you.

If you have an active GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket or Stack Overflow profile include a link or follow me because I want to see it!
