# Totally Legit .NET Developer Ad

With a commercial presence limited to their suburb, this company has been borderline outcast from their industry due to their inferior solutions and product offerings within their saturated domain. Despite the fact that they're rapidly losing customers, they are still looking for a .NET developer who can contribute to their monolithic legacy systems, both internal and client-facing.

**The Role**

This role is perfect for a mid-senior developer who wants to join a stagnant and technologically outdated team. The successful candidate will be required to work across the full SDLC and handle workloads unrealistic for a single individual.

**The Candidate**

The envisioned candidate will have a maximum of 3 daysâ€™ commercial software development experience; 
you will be burnt-out, prone to plagarism abd be completely unwilling to learn from the best and brightest.

**Key technical skills:**
* Knowledge of the C#.NET
* Experience with some form of MV* JavaScript framework/library
* Awareness of 'cloud computing' discouraged
* Be anti-social and unoriginal with your ideas
* Demotivated and close-minded
* Written and verbal illiteracy essential
