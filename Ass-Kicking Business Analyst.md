# Ass-Kicking Business Analyst

I'm on the lookout for an analytical and process/detail-oriented business analyst who is looking to take the lead in shaping an industry-leading product. This role will play a critical part in the planning and initial development stages of a major platform upgrade. You will work cross-functionally with multiple business units to generate innovatie solutions and ultimately create a next-generation product that solves existing industry problems. 

This is an individual contributor role that requires exceptional analytical skills, bias toward action, strong collaboration and communication skills. You will need to have experience with pushing the limits of business process automation, working on products that undergo massive traffic loads and collaborating closely with software engineers to create inspired software. 

For this project, you'll need to be passionate about your work, view the world through an analytical lens and be capable of learning quickly.

**You will need:**
* The ability to devise innovative new business processes and automated applications
* Solid experience with Kanban or Scrum
* Tertiary qualifications in business or technology

**Experience in any of the following is valued but not essential:**
* Domain driven design (DDD)
* Process modelling in BPMN
