# Full-stack Java Developer - Startup

This is the awesome Java project you've been waiting for. Get on board with a rapidly growing, well-backed and market validated startup that's building a game-changing product - and they're using Java. Despite being a startup, they've got serious experience behind them and know what's needed for success, both for the business and for the people in it - you won't be expected to work 80 hour weeks or pivot every 3 days.

When they say full stack, they don't mean just front and back end. Along with being a generally independent and self-managing person, you'll need to be comfortable with setting up your own CI/CD pipelines (to an extent, it won't be entirely from scratch) and learning new tech if the problem you're solving calls for it. The stack currently consists of Java, Angular (not Angular.js) and Go.

This bunch do tech tests so if you're keen to work on something exciting and back yourself as being able to solve problems, hit me up and we can have a chat about this opportunity. Not really what you're looking for but you're interested in having a confidential discussion about other potential opportunities? Get in touch, your dream job could be waiting on the other side.
