.NET Developer - Core + AWS
======

## Help an epic brand take their technology offerings to the next level

Come be part of a team that's tasked with building new functionality across a variety of products and services. You'll get to collaborate with a multi-functional group of people who are passionate about their craft and love the brand they get to help build.

Do you strive to ensure you follow proper engineering principles? Are you excited by the idea of taking a household name and overhauling both their customer facing and in-house technology? This is the opportunity for you.

Ideally, you'll have had experience with:

* .NET Core
* Microservices architecture
* RESTful APIs and services
* Building applications that make use of AWS (EC2, RDS, ECS, S3 etc.)
* Working in a commercial software engineering environment that actually practises TDD, CI/CD and Agile

Bonus points if you've had exposure (commercial or otherwise) to:

* Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, Openshift etc.
* React, Vue, Aurelia etc.
* 3rd Party API integration

If you have an active GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket or Stack Overflow profile include a link because I want to see it!
