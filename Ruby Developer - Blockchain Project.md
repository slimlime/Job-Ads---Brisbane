# Ruby Developer - Blockchain Project

Do not adjust your screen, your eyes are not deceiving you - this is an opportunity to work on a Ruby on Rails product built utilizing blockchain technology.

You'll be helping a small team improve on an existing product that's been built by them from the ground up. This is truly industry-distrupting stuff that 
has the potential to change entire worlds; it's a simple concept on paper that requires cutting-edge technology and novel thinking to solve challenging 
problems and bring it into reality.

If you want to literally change the world, hit me up and we can discuss this opportunity in more detail. Not really what you're looking for but you're 
interested in having a confidential discussion about other potential opportunities? Get in touch, your dream job could be waiting on the other side.

If you have an active GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket or Stack Overflow profile include a link or follow me because I want to see it!
