Junior Software Developer
======

## Junior position, super interesting projects and the chance to help shape an engineering culture

Looking for a chance to do more than just build crud line of business applications? No longer feeling challenged by your grad job? Do not despair, here is your salvation. This is an opportunity to dive head first into an environment with a rich pool of domain knowledge for you to immerse yourself in and intensely interesting projects to get involved in.

If you've left information off your CV for the sake of keeping it to 1 page, don't. If you think it's relevant, chuck it on, arbitrary page limit be damned. A significant portion of the codebase is Ruby so any prior experience programming with it is helpful but not essential although ideally, you'll be fairly comfortable with some kind of objected-oriented progrmaming language. More important than programming language is experience with (or at least an understanding of) commercial dev practises; source control, TDD, CI/CD etc.

If you see something dumb or incorrect in my ads, let me know! Constructive criticism is always appreciated.

If you have an active GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket or Stack Overflow profile include a link because I want to see it!
