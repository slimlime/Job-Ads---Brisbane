# Gold Coast .NET Developer

A fast-growing enterprise software company on the GC is currently making some major waves in their industry and are looking to expand their team. They have a number of product offerings that are undergoing major upgrades as well as incoming greenfields projects so there's exciting work to be done and great people to do it with.

This is a team that actually cares about their test coverage and how scalable their code is because at the end of the day, their commercial survival depends on it. If you sign up, be prepared to do things the right way, as Microsoft intended.

Stack-wise, you will need to be familiar with:
* .NET MVC or Core
* Building bespoke APIs from the ground up
* Angular and TypeScript
* CI/CD tools
* TDD

It'll also be awesome if you've had experience with:
* Angular and/or TypeScript
* Cloud computing (AWS, Azure or Google Cloud)

If you're keen to work close to the beach, hit me up and we can discuss this opportunity in more detail! Not quite your thing but still interested in having a chat about what's out there? Get in touch, your dream job could be on the other side.
