## Leverage your software development experience to act as a force multiplier for others and deliver mission-critical software wth a global user-base ##

This national software company is looking for someone to uplift, guide and inspire one of their product development teams!

You'll be joining a sub-10-person group with considerable IP in their product who work closely with SMEs to deliver high-quality features to a diverse userbase. This is a role that's more about working on the team as opposed to in the team, focusing on helping others to make bigger impacts rather than jumping on the tools yourself.

**What you'll be doing**
* Organizing development processes, driving improvements, and leading by example.
* Breaking down complex tasks, providing estimations together with the team, ensuring high code and product quality.
* Coaching and mentoring your team members and supporting their career development.
* Working closely with business and SME teams to set expectations, triage incidents, and provide a software development perspective on project planning and management.
* Designing and redesigning software architecture in accordance with both best practise and user needs.

**You'll ideally have**
* A background in software development using .NET.
* An appreciation for DevOps principals, testing and the value they bring to software development.
* Experience with modernising desktop applications, especially from within complex and/or mission-critical environments.
* A passion for improving the developer experience.
* Experience leading or influencing a software development team.

**What you'll get in return**
* Highly flexible working arrangements
* Competitive remuneration
* Opportunities to develop impactful software that's already been fielded internationally
