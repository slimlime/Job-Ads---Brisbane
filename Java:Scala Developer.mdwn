This is an exciting opportunity to join a well-organized and post-revenue SaaS startup who are growing organically and expanding their engineering team. Their product presents a clear and straightforward value-prop to users and presents an opportunity to ultimately work less and produce more!

**You'll ideally have**
* Commercial experience developing software with Java
* A can-do attitude and a love for problem-solving
* Exposure to public cloud computing platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure etc.)
* Experience using the Atlassian suite
