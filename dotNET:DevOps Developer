## Harold Liu | Join a small and talent-dense team building software supporting a multi-billion dollar industry in Australia ##

This is an opportunity to join an autonomous group of technologists who are building software to support a multi-billion dollar industry in Australia. You'll be working directly with the CTO, senior developers, and industry SME's in designing, developing, and ultimately scaling both the product and internal software infrastructure.

The roadmap for the next 9-12 months is to both capitalise on new opportunities to create new business efficiencies through software while also continuing to modernise their existing development processes and applications.

You'll be working in collaboration with leaders and colleagues who'll provide you with full agency in solving problems as you see fit while still giving support whenever you need it; this is a group who want you for your opinions as much as they want you for your skills.

**You'll ideally have**
* Commercial experience with .NET CoreÂ 
* Familiarity with or interest in software and network security best practices
* Knowledge of or experience with writing infrastructure as code
* Experience leveraging AWS for deployments, containerisation, and/or orchestration

**What you'll get in return**
* Competitive remuneration
* Remote-first working arrangement with the option of a CBD office available to you when you want it
* Opportunities for both role and technical challenge growth as the business scales into 2021
