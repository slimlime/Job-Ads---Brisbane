* Mastery of all things JVM - Java, Scala and/or Groovy.
* Familiarity with other languages, frameworks and libraries across the stack - Go, Node.js, Angular, Aurelia etc.
* Experience (commercial or recreational) with using dev tools and technologies such as Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, serverless computing etc.

**Other Requirements**
* A desire to truly drive change and innovate while working on enterprise-scale products.
* A demonstratable passion for software development.
