## Leave your mark on some of Brisbane's most exciting digital projects! ##

This is your chance to join a fast-growing company focused on delivering beautiful, highly responsive applications and websites for some of the most influential organisations in Australia. You'll be responsible for building and maintaining these products and services while working under the mentorship of more senior developers within the team.

Being a good communicator will set you up for success in this role as you’ll be working alongside developers, architects, designers and project managers to help deliver elegant solutions to customers’ problems. You’ll be collaborating with others on projects to begin with but in time, you’ll be entrusted to handle your own solo projects and empowered with support to get them over the line.

**What you’ll ideally have on your first day**
* An eagerness for learning and pride in the work you produce.
* Commercial experience with .NET MVC, JavaScript and LESS/SASS.
* An eye for detail and the ability to understand and build testable, maintainable, clean code.
* A sense of humour.

**Things that’ll give you a head start**
* Experience with CMS or mobile (native or cross platform) development
* Prior experience working in a digital agency or similar environments where you had to juggle delivery deadlines

**What you’ll get in return**
* The mentorship and training of an award-winning team of developers, designers and business people
* Opportunities to grow with the company and expand your skill set
* Experience in an environment where your work has a direct effect on the company and customer success.
* An epic perks package that includes paid gym classes, conference/workshop allowances and the occasional baked goods platter
