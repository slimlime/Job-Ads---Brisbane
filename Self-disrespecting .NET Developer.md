# Self-disrespecting .NET Wizard

Have you grown tired of creating innovative products and using modern technologies? Feel like your daily workflow is too coherent and productive? Do you daydream of working for a developer-unfriendly company that combines the business competence of Pied Piper with the ethical leadership of Cersei Lannister. 

This latest #JDPexclusive will see you putting out fires (both figuratively and literally) and maintaining a monolithic codebase so spaghetti, there are jars of Leggos kept on top of the server. Just in case.

Sounding good so far? Put on your robe and wizard hat and keep reading.

The ideal candidate will have experience with developing highly-scalable, cloud-based **dapps** that use **machine learning** and **big data** to **disrupt** their target industry.

If this is something you want to subject yourself to, reach out to me using the internet and we can discuss this 'opportunity' in more detail.

See something dumb or incorrect in my ads? Let me know, constructive criticism is welcomed and always appreciated.
