# Ultra Risky Ethereum Developer Role - Java

Well, you made it this far: This is a Brisbane-based opportunity

This is you:

 * Comfortable with Core Java (7 or 8)
 * Familiar with some kind of modern JVM REST API framework (Spring Boot, Play, RestExpress etc.)
 * An understanding of fundamental blockchain concepts would be helpful (hash trees, Dapps etc.)
 * Obsessed with creating and delivering cutting-edge, world-changing products

Keen? Hit me up and we can discuss this opportunity in more detail! Not quite your thing but still interested in having a chat about what's out there? Get in touch, your dream job could be on the other side.

See something dumb or incorrect in one of my ads? Let me know! Constructive criticism is always appreciated.
