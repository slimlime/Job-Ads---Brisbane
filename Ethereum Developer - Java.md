# Ultra Risky Ethereum Developer Role - Java

Well, you made it this far: This is a Brisbane-based opportunity to work on some ground-breaking products built on the Ethereum blockchain and implemented in Java. 

This is you:

 * Comfortable with Core Java (7 or 8)
 * Familiar with some kind of modern JVM REST API framework (Spring Boot, Play, RestExpress etc.)
 * An understanding of fundamental blockchain concepts would be helpful (hash trees, Dapps etc.)
 * Obsessed with creating and delivering cutting-edge, world-changing products

If you want to hear the rest, follow me on here and email me your GitHub username and the best way to contact you (preferably phone number). Confident that'll be enough to get you this job? Leave it at that. If not, also email me a copy of your CV (or just do that anyway).

See something dumb or incorrect in one of my ads? Let me know! Constructive criticism is always appreciated.

If you have an active GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket or Stack Overflow profile include a link or follow me because I want to see it!
