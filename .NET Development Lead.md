# .NET Development Lead

If you're an experienced developer who's looking for that next step up into technical leadership, this is the opportunity you've been waiting for! This is a chance to help define, design and deliver the next stages of a highly complex, fully cloud-based software platform.

This is a challenging position that'll require an innovative thought leader who can think outside of the box to design future proofed solutions. You'll get to be hands-on with software architecture while still remaining on the tools and cutting code from time to time.

You will spend roughly 40% of your time coding, 25% architecting and 35% providing technical leadership and mentoring to Scrum teams of both onshore and off-shore developers. You'll have the chance to be involved in projects that span APIs, web applications, CMS builds and mobile apps.

**Technically, you will ideally have:**

* Experience in .NET (C#, ASP.NET, MVC 5+), JavaScript (NodeJS and Angular).
* Exposure to cloud architecture, preferably Azure.
* Experience in Agile methodologies, preferably SCRUM.
* Experience using the Atlassian Suite for workflow management and CI/CD.

**Bonus points if you have:**

* Experience in leading offshore development teams involved in multiple concurrent projects
* Experience working with Sitecore and/or Wordpress
* Exposure to cross-platform mobile app development, preferably Xamarin

Keen? Hit me up and we can discuss this opportunity in more detail! Not quite your thing but still interested in having a chat about what's out there? Get in touch, your dream job could be on the other side.
