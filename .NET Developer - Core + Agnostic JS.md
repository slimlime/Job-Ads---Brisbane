.NET Developer - Core/Agnostic JS
======

## Be part of bringing a major piece of social infrastructure into the digital age!

I feel super privileged to be helping one of Brisbane's best-kept secrets grow their software development team, with the ultimate aim of further modernizing their commercial processes and software platform.

You'll be joining a team who have worked hard to bring their products to where they are today yet there's still a ton of room for further growth and they're excited about it. The existing codebase is cloud-hosted and very modern on the server-side while the UI is essentially a blank canvas in terms of tech and primed for taking a leap forward into modern JS.

To hit the ground running with this crew, you'll ideally have experience using .NET Core to develop scalable applications. Exposure to modern development practices (TDD, CI/CD etc.) properly applied to a cross-functional team environment would also be helpful.

Interested? Hit me up for an obligation-free conversation.

If you have an active GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket or Stack Overflow profile include a link because I want to see it!

Currently rereading: "Rainbow Six" by Tom Clancy. Always open to book recommendations!
