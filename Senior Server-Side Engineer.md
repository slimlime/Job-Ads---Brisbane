## Join a company that's building a revolutionary SaaS product from QLD. Work remotely, contribute to something you believe in.

This is simultaneously one of Brisbane's best kept tech secrets and one of it's most 
promising software companies. Well-funded, driven by proven technical leadership and 
powered by groundbreaking tech, this is the result of a rare intersection of people, 
skills and circumstance.
You'll be building, maintaining and extending services that power highly sophisticated 
software that's already in use internationally. The team you'll be joining is comprised of 
multi-talented individuals who understand what it means to collaborate autonomously and 
don't see that phrase as being an oxymoron.

**What You'll Ideally Have**
* Experience shipping software under a diverse range of conditions and a variety of 
environments.
* Familiarity with building highly scalable, available and secure systems for the web.
* Commercial experience with OO languages and static typing.
* Knowledge of how to implement containerisation and orchestration.
* Knowledge of when it doesn't make sense to do so.

**What You'll Get in Return**
* The chance to tackle a set of problems and work on software that's unique to the 
Brisbane market.
* A capable, user-focused team of technologists who believe in delivering useful and 
enjoyable software with minimal stress.
* A company that'll provide you with growth avenues and leadership that sees that value in 
providing them to you.
* If you have an active GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket or Stack Overflow profile, include a 
link because I want to see it!
