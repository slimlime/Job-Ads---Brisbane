# Graduate .NET Developer

Graduate program season may have come and gone but fear not, JDP still has awesome clients who are keen to bring in the next generation of kickass software developers. You'll have input on how user stories are created and have direct visibility over the effect your code has on the business. Forget being a cog in a machine somewhere, here's your chance to actually collaborate with your peers, learn off some of the best in the biz and do more than just crush code.

If you've left information off your CV for the sake of keeping it to 1 page, don't. If you think it's relevant, chuck it on, arbitrary page limit be damned. Experience coding in C# and a desire to kickstart your evolution into a fully-fledged .NET developer are essential. A demonstratable interest in programming and a sense of self-awareness will also give you an advantage over the competition.

Not a grad but you're interested in having a confidential discussion about other potential opportunities? Get in touch, your dream job could be waiting on the other side.

If you have an active GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket or Stack Overflow profile include a link or follow me because I want to see it!
