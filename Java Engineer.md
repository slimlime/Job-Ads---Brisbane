# Java Engineer

Join a team that's leading the way in prototyping new technical initiatives and implementing them throughout other engineering functions. At the moment, microservices are the name of the game so if you've had experience implementing them with Play, Akka or Spring Boot, you'll fit right now. That's not to say that you need to have Scala experience or anything like that (although if you do, cool!) but you **will** need to be very comfortable with modern iterations of Core Java (7 or 8).

Transcend the shackles of the code monkey - shape and innovate web-scale software engineering instead.

Sound like something you'd be interested in? Get in touch! Not really what you're looking for but you're interested in seeing what else is out there or exploring what's trending in tech at the moment Get in touch, I'm always keen for a chat about cool things happening in dev!

If you see something dumb or incorrect in my ads, let me know! Constructive criticism is always appreciated.

If you have an active GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket or Stack Overflow profile include a link or follow me because I want to see it!
