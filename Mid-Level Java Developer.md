# Mid-Level Java Developer

So you're a developer who's comfortable with the JVM; great. You've learned the basics of commercial software development and can now write code that scales reasonably well and is somewhat legible to others...now what? Join (or stay with) a huge enterprise and continue to grease the wheels of capitalist oppression with your blood, sweat and tears?

How 'bout screw that, use your powers for good and not evil? Four simple points below, if you're picking up what I'm putting down, this may in fact be your dream job.

 * You know Core Java - bonus points if you've also used something like Scala or Kotlin.
 * You've worked with some kind of modern JVM REST API framework (Spring Boot, Play, RestExpress etc.)
 * You understand or are interested in all things blockchain (hash trees, Dapps etc.)
 * You want to create incredible products and experiences for the people to enjoy.

If this isn't you, hit me up anyway, I work with some of the most incredible companies in Brisbane whom you've likely never heard of before.
